     <title>The talk</title>
     <link>https://gablaxy.github.io/soper/articles/future_space</link>
     <description>I started outlining the different topics i will talk about on this blog, like space and tech "news", sci-fi/fantasy writings of my own maybe. 
     For the tech things, i think it will be mostly about open source because that's what i like the most in computer science.
     I also want to make some place on this website to keep track of the ideas i get, so that they don't disappear when i throw the piece of paper i wrote them on without thinking.
     I may add a tag system on this blog if it starts to scale up a bit...</description>

     <link>https://gablaxy.github.io/soper/articles/hello%20world</link>
     <description>First blog post, I think i will try to relocate the website as soon as possible to be independant totally, at the same time i will try to add more content on this website, for example blog posts, books to read, a showcase of my projects and other things. </description>
