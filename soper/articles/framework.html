                Hello again,
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I'm writing from my moldy student flat. I have been thinking about relocating to a university dorm as there are some new ones that just opened this September. I just don't know if they have any spaces left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just thinking about the papers and all the administration-related things that I'm gonna have to do to move less than two kilometers is making my brain hurt a little. But university dorms are less expensive in my country (and every other country I think...), probably less moldy, and they have better insulation. As winter is starting, I don't want to freeze to death because my radiator is currently heating the outside more than the inside, rofl.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, the main topic of this article was to talk about the Framework laptop. I am currently pondering if I should buy one because the only laptop I have now is a "gaming one" that is really heavy and has no battery life. It is now 3.5 years old, and with how electronic devices' life expectancy is always getting worse and worse somehow, I don't want to find myself without any computer during my now starting (I mean it's been already 3 months but whatever) first year of master.
            </p>
            <p>
                So back to our topic, I already knew about framework but it was a bit too expensive for me, now it's within my budget (even if it's still a bit expensive) and it really aligns well with my view, I want the most sustainable laptop possible and a laptop that comes with no pre-installed OS so I can do what I want with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love their iniative and I hope that it inspire a lot of other people to do similar things in tech or just in everyday utilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                However I still have one problem, thanks to the type of credit card I have, my maximum withdrawal amount is near the price of the laptop I want lol  (DIY framework 13, with pretty much the cheapest options). I have thinked about different way to solve this problem (so that I doesn't end up without being able to buy anything else, like food or rent rofl, for the rest of the month), their website doesn't allow paypal or multiple time payement, and I think I may be able to buy it near the end of the year or the start of 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Thanks for reading my mess of an article and see you next time.
