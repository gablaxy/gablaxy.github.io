                First update on my situation,
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm happy to say that I no longer live in a moldy flat in the city center but near my uni in a brand new building made for students.
                The flat is really nice and the only downside is that I don't know what the architect was thinking when designing the interior because the placement of the outlets makes no sense...
                Otherwise I love it here, I love that I now have a big window that brings in a lot of light, my plants are gonna love it !!!
            </p>
            <p>
                Onto the topic of this article, I got my framework during the winter holidays, I bought the AMD DIY version without any ram or storage.
                I ordered instantly those two things because I couldn't wait anymore to build it ! 
            </p>
            <p>
                As advertised it was so easy to install anything, it brought me so much joy. 
                I also discovered some details like the facts that the replacement screws have a place directly in the laptop and not in a plastic bag that I would have lost in no time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I installed manjaro with gnome as a desktop environment for now, I will see how that goes, maybe I will change but I don't know. I pondered for some time between this and debian but as I saw that the official support for framework was primarely Ubuntu and Manjaro, I chose the one that for me is less profit oriented.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now I really like it, i was thinking that the battery would be atrocious but it is not that bad and the only problem I encountered was that the right click on the touch pad isn't working but as I always use and external mouse I didn't even took it apart to check if a the cable is maybe not fully connected.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will probably make another post in a few month to a year to give a review when the laptop has more mileage.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for reading me.</p>
